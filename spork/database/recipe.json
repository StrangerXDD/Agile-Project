            "Flank steak": "2 lb.",
            "Coarse salt": "1/2 teaspoon",
            "Ground black pepper": "1/2 teaspoon",
            "Soy sauce": "1/2 cup",
            "Honey": "2\u20133 tablespoons"

        "instructions": "1) Begin by placing the flank steak onto a large cutting board. Use a meat tenderizer to even out your cut of meat. The goal here isn\u2019t a certain thickness, rather to get everything even.\r\n2) Next, transfer the flank steak onto a large baking sheet with edges. You will be marinating the meat on the baking sheet.\r\n3) Sprinkle both sides of the flank steak with salt and pepper and massage the spices into the meat.\r\n4) Next, whisk together the soy sauce and honey and pour the marinade over the flank steak.\r\n5) Cover the flank steak with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, flipping the flank steak at 1 hour to make sure both sides of the flank steak have time to marinate. Alternatively, you can use a large, gallon-size bag or casserole dish.\r\n6) Preheat the grill to 450\u00baF \u2013 500\u00baF.\r\n7) Remove the meat from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes.\r\n8) Next, shake out any excess marinade from the flank steak and then sear the steak over direct heat for 1-2 minutes on each side (the grill should be very hot).\r\n9) Then, move the flank steak over to indirect heat and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping after 5 minutes. This will vary on how hot your grill is. Be sure to check the internal temperature of the steak at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and so on until the internal temperature reaches about 130\u00ba \u2013 135\u00ba for a medium-rare flank steak.\r\n10) Remove the steak from the grill and let it rest for 5 minutes.\r\n11) Slice the flank steak into strips by cutting the meat across the grain of the steak to break up the muscle fibers in the steak.\r\n12) Serve and enjoy!",

In a separate bowl, combine the water, yeast and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Let sit about 10 minutes; stir until all yeast is dissolved. Add the oil to the liquid mixture, stirring . Add half of the liquid mixture to the flour mixture. Mix with hands to moisten flour as much as possible. Add remaining liquid mixture to dough and mix until flour is thoroughly incorporated. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand until smooth and elastic to the touch, about 15 minutes, gradually adding only enough additional flour to keep dough from sticking. Place in a large greased bowl and invert dough so top is greased; cover with a dry towel and let stand in a warm place (90 - 100F) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch down dough. To Make Bread: Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Form each into a ball, then stretch out dough with both hands and tuck edges under to form a smooth surface. Pop any large air bubbles by pinching them. Form into loaves. (Note: I like to use a rolling pin and roll out dough, which pops all bubbles easily and quickly.) Place in 3 greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch loaf pans. Cover with towel again and allow to rise until almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) until dark brown and done, about 1 hour, rotating the pans after 25 minutes for more even browning. Remove from pan as soon as bread will easily lift out, after about 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool about 1 hour before slicing.",

Stir in yeast, and let stand until mixture gets foamy. Add slightly beaten eggs. If using an electric mixer, add 4 1/2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Mix until flour is mixed in, and dough gets stringy. This stringiness indicates that the gluten has developed. Continue to add flour until dough is all on dough hook; 1 or 2 cups is usually sufficient. Let hook continue to knead for several minutes. Dough should be smooth and elastic. To knead by hand, stir 4 1/2 cups of flour in to the yeast mixture. Turn soft dough onto lightly floured surface, and work in 1 to 2 cups of flour. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place dough into a greased bowl, and turn several times to coat the surface. Cover bowl with a damp cloth. Let dough rise until doubled in bulk. Punch down after first rising, and allow to rise a second time. The first rising is about 1 hour, the second about 45 minutes. Two risings makes for a better bread, but if time is a problem just do one. Divide dough in half, and divide each half into three or four equal parts. Make two braids, and place both breads on a greased baking sheet. Cover, and allow to rise until doubled. Brush with beaten egg. Sprinkle with poppy seeds, if desired. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes until golden brown. Allow loaves to cool on a wire rack.",

Add the panko and Parmesan to a third shallow bowl and whisk to combine. \r\n3) Coat the chicken in the flour, shaking off any excess. Then, dip in the eggs, letting any excess drip off. Finally, coat in the panko-Parmesan mixture, making sure all sides are covered. Transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board. \r\n4) Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pan, add the chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, between 2 and 3 minutes per side. \r\n5) Transfer the chicken to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Garnish the chicken cutlets with the parsley and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing on top.",

Take a cheese stick and dip it into the egg, letting the excess drip off. Then coat it in the bread crumbs, shake off the excess, and place on a tray.  Repeat with the remaining cheese sticks.  Once each cheese stick has been breaded, take each one through the egg and bread crumbs again for a second coating, at a minimum. I prefer to bread the cheese sticks three times for a more robust shell, but two coats is sufficient to prevent the cheese from leaking during cooking. Freeze the mozzarella sticks, on the tray, for at least for two hours. Heat the tallow or frying fat of choice to 365F, using either a deep fryer or a heavy bottomed 8\" saucepan monitored with a thermometer. You want the fat to come a few inches up the sides of the pan. Fry the mozzarella sticks in batches**** for about 2 minutes, until golden brown. Let the cheese sticks drain briefly on a paper towel, then serve promptly with marinara or your favorite dunking sauce. Enjoy!",

The time will really vary depending on if you sliced the potatoes or cut them into chunks, and how large, but for me it usually only takes about 5 minutes once the water is boiling, about 10-15 minutes total. Once the potatoes are fork tender, drain them in a colander and let them sit for a few minutes for the excess steam to come off. While the potatoes are still warm, toss them well with the dressing. Stir in the celery, scallions, and chives, then serve warm or chill for several hours before serving. Enjoy! ",

Mix together all spices and set aside.\r\nNext, remove the chicken from the packaging and place the chicken on a clean, dry cutting board. \r\nRemove excess moisture from the chicken with a paper towel.\r\nTo spatchcock the chicken, set the chicken breast-side down on a cutting board and use very sharp kitchen shears to begin cutting down one side of the spine through the ribs and then repeat on the other side of the spine. Discard the spine. \r\nFlip the chicken over onto the chicken breasts and use your hands to press on the middle of the bird pressing down firmly to flatten the chicken. \r\nPlace the chicken on a large plate and carefully separate the chicken meat from the chicken skin with your hand. \r\nCarefully rub 1 teaspoon salt on the chicken meat under the skin being sure the chicken meat is covered with salt. \r\nNext, season the whole chicken with the all purpose chicken seasoning. Be sure the whole chicken is covered (skin, legs, thighs, etc.). Then, refrigerate the chicken for at least 2 hours or overnight.\r\nWhen you are ready to cook, preheat the oven to 425\u00baF and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. \r\nRemove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature. \r\nPlace the onion, garlic, thyme, white wine, \u00bd cup of broth, and 1 tablespoon olive oil on top of the aluminum foil and sprinkle with the remaining \u00bd teaspoon salt.  \r\nPlace a metal rack on top of the foil and vegetables and carefully place the whole chicken flat on top of the metal rack breast-side up. \r\nRub the chicken with the additional 2 tablespoons of oil. Be sure to really massage the oil into the chicken. \r\nPlace the chicken in the oven and bake at 425\u00baF for 35-45 minutes or until the whole bird has an internal temperature of at least 160\u00ba. Make sure to take the temperature at the thickest parts.\r\nRemove the chicken from the oven and let the chicken rest for at least 15 minutes. Your chicken should continue to cook 5\u00baF to make the internal temperature 165\u00baF.\r\nWhile the chicken is resting, prepare the sauce. Add all of the cooked vegetables, liquid, and herbs from the bottom of the pan into a small saucepan along with the rest of the broth (1 cup). \r\nBring the sauce to a boil and then turn the heat to medium/low and add the lemon juice. \r\nThen, carefully sprinkle the cornstarch into the sauce and whisk. Let the sauce cook over medium heat until thick. Remove from heat and discard the herb stems. \r\nCarve the chicken and serve with the sauce. ",
